<UL><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The States Parties to the present 
  Convention,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Considering that, in accordance with the 
  principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the 
  inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the 
  human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
  world,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Bearing in mind that the peoples of the United 
  Nations have, in the Charter, reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human 
  rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person, and have determined 
  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger 
  freedom,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recognizing that the United Nations has, in the 
  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenants on 
  Human Rights, proclaimed and agreed that everyone is entitled to all the 
  rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such 
  as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national 
  or social origin, property, birth or other status,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recalling that, in the Universal Declaration of 
  Human Rights, the United Nations has proclaimed that childhood is entitled to 
  special care and assistance,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Convinced that the family, as the fundamental 
  group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of 
  all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary 
  protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities 
  within the community,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recognizing that the child, for the full and 
  harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family 
  environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Considering that the child should be fully 
  prepared to live an individual life in society, and brought up in the spirit 
  of the ideals proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, and in 
  particular in the spirit of peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and 
  solidarity,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Bearing in mind that the need to extend 
  particular care to the child has been stated in the Geneva Declaration of the 
  Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child 
  adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1959 and recognized in the 
  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the International Covenant on Civil 
  and Political Rights (in particular in articles 23 and 24), in the 
  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in particular 
  in article 10) and in the statutes and relevant instruments of specialized 
  agencies and international organizations concerned with the welfare of 
  children, '</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the 
  Declaration of the Rights of the Child, "the child, by reason of his physical 
  and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including 
  appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth",</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recalling the provisions of the Declaration on 
  Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of 
  Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally 
  and Internationally; the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
  Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) ; and the Declaration 
  on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed 
  Conflict,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recognizing that, in all countries in the world, 
  there are children living in exceptionally difficult conditions, and that such 
  children need special consideration,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Taking due account of the importance of the 
  traditions and cultural values of each people for the protection and 
  harmonious development of the child,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Recognizing the importance of international 
  co-operation for improving the living conditions of children in every country, 
  in particular in the developing countries,</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Have agreed as follows:</FONT> </P></UL>

<UL><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>States Parties shall undertake all appropriate 
  legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the

  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. States Parties shall ensure the 
  implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law and their 
  obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, in 
  particular where the child would otherwise be stateless.</FONT> </P></UL>
<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 8</FONT></I></B></H4>
<UL><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>1. States Parties undertake to respect the 
  right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, 
  name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful 
  interference.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. Where a child is illegally deprived of some

<UL><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>1. States Parties shall ensure that a child 
  shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when 
  competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with 
  applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best 
  interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular 
  case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or 
  one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to 
  the child's place of residence.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. In any proceedings pursuant to paragraph 1 of

  any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, 
  exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the 
  person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, 
  that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if 
  appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information 
  concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the 
  provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the 
  child. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a

public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or 
morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</FONT>

by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and 
material from a diversity of national and international sources, especially 
those aimed at the promotion of his or her social, spiritual and moral 
well-being and physical and mental health. To this end, States Parties 
shall:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(a) Encourage the mass media to disseminate 
information and material of social and cultural benefit to the child and in 
accordance with the spirit of article 29;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(b) Encourage international co-operation in the 
production, exchange and dissemination of such information and material from a 
diversity of cultural, national and international sources;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(c) Encourage the production and dissemination of 
children's books;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(d) Encourage the mass media to have particular 
regard to the linguistic needs of the child who belongs to a minority group or 
who is indigenous;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(e) Encourage the development of appropriate 
guidelines for the protection of the child from information and material 
injurious to his or her well-being, bearing in mind the provisions of articles 
13 and 18.</FONT> 
<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 18</FONT></I></B></H4><FONT 
face=Arial,Helvetica>1. States Parties shall use their best efforts to ensure 
recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for 
the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, 
legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and 
development of the child. The best interests of the child will be their basic 
concern.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. For the purpose of guaranteeing and promoting 
the rights set forth in the present Convention, States Parties shall render 
appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of 
their child-rearing responsibilities and shall ensure the development of 
institutions, facilities and services for the care of children.</FONT>

face=Arial,Helvetica>1. States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, 
administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all 
forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent 
treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the 
care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the 
child.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. Such protective measures should, as 
appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social 
programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the 
care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for 
identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of 
instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for 
judicial involvement.</FONT> 
<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 20</FONT></I></B></H4><FONT 
face=Arial,Helvetica>1. A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or 
her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to 
remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and 
assistance provided by the State.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. States Parties shall in accordance with their 
national laws ensure alternative care for such a child.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>3. Such care could include, inter alia, foster 
placement, kafalah of Islamic law, adoption or if necessary placement in 
suitable institutions for the care of children. When considering solutions, due 
regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing 
and to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background.</FONT> 

<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 21</FONT></I></B></H4><FONT 
face=Arial,Helvetica>States Parties that recognize and/or permit the system of 
adoption shall ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the 
paramount consideration and they shall:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(a) Ensure that the adoption of a child is 
authorized only by competent authorities who determine, in accordance with 
applicable law and procedures and on the basis of all pertinent and reliable 
information, that the adoption is permissible in view of the child's status 
concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the 
persons concerned have given their informed consent to the adoption on the basis 
of such counselling as may be necessary;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(b) Recognize that inter-country adoption may be 
considered as an alternative means of child's care, if the child cannot be 
placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be 
cared for in the child's country of origin; (c) Ensure that the child concerned 
by inter-country adoption enjoys safeguards and standards equivalent to those 
existing in the case of national adoption;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(d) Take all appropriate measures to ensure that, 
in inter-country adoption, the placement does not result in improper financial 
gain for those involved in it;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(e) Promote, where appropriate, the objectives of 
the present article by concluding bilateral or multilateral arrangements or 
agreements, and endeavour, within this framework, to ensure that the placement 
of the child in another country is carried out by competent authorities or 
organs.</FONT> 
<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 22</FONT></I></B></H4><FONT 
face=Arial,Helvetica>1. States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure 
that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee in

person, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the 
enjoyment of applicable rights set forth in the present Convention and in other 
international human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the said States 
are Parties.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. For this purpose, States Parties shall provide, 
as they consider appropriate, co-operation in any efforts by the United Nations 
and other competent intergovernmental organizations or non-governmental 
organizations co-operating with the United Nations to protect and assist such a 
child and to trace the parents or other members of the family of any refugee 
child in order to obtain information necessary for reunification with his or her 
family. In cases where no parents or other members of the family can be found, 
the child shall be accorded the same protection as any other child permanently 
or temporarily deprived of his or her family environment for any reason , as set 
forth in the present Convention.</FONT> 
<H4><B><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Article 23</FONT></I></B></H4><FONT
